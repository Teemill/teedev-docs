# TeeDev Docs

## What are the TeeDev Docs?

The TeeDev Docs provide the documentation for all TeeDev repositories.

They are built using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and are written
predominantly in Markdown (the same language used in GitHub comments and issues),
with some additional Vue code.
