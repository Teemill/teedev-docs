# Introduction

## What is TeeDev?

TeeDev is a coding sandbox for experimenting with various programming languages,
frameworks, packages etc.

TeeDev is divided into several GitHub repositories, including

- [teedev](https://github.com/Teemill/teedev), a Vue based frontend application
- [teedev-api](https://github.com/Teemill/teedev-api), a Laravel based backend
  application
- [teedev-docs](https://github.com/Teemill/teedev-docs), a VuePress based
  documentation page (and what you are looking at right now)

TeeDev is designed for experimentation and for developing fun projects. You
can develop literally anything you want. It doesn't have to be work related.

## What if I want to do something else?

Then you can always create another repo.
